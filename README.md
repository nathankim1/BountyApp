# BountyApp
This web application is built on a Vite React frontend using Typescript, a Node.js and Express.js backend, and MongoDB database. It is deployed in Docker containers to the Google Cloud Platform.<br /><br />
I originally made this app because I was keeping track of large group purchases on my Notes app on my phone, but I was getting annoyed of doing everything manually.<br /><br />
This is my first full-stack web application, and I'm insanely glad to have finished it and put it on the web for anyone to check out and or use!
